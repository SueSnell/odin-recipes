            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

               <ul>

                <li>3 pounds beef eye of round roast, at room temperature</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
               </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            
               <ol>

                    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                    
                    <li>Make sure roast is at room temperature. Tie roast at 3-inch intervals with cotton twine; this helps it from drying out and allows it to cook more evenly. Place roast on a rack in a baking pan.</li>
                    <li>Mix together salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Rub seasoning mixture into the meat.</li>
                    <li>Place in the preheated oven and roast for 60 minutes, or 20 minutes per pound if your roast is larger or smaller. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 120 to 125 degrees F (49 to 52 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Cover loosely with foil, and let rest so juices can redistribute, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Slice and serve.</li>
                   
               </ol>
